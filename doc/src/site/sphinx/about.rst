About

Spark-Mongodb is a library that allows the user to read/write data with `Spark SQL <http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html>`__
from/into MongoDB collections.

`MongoDB <http://www.mongodb.org>`__ provides a documental data model
richer than typical key/value systems. `Spark <http://spark.incubator.apache.org/>`__ is a
fast and general-purpose cluster computing system that can run applications up to 100 times faster than Hadoop.

Integrating MongoDB and Spark gives us a system that combines the best of both
worlds opening to MongoDB the possibility of solving a wide range of new use cases.
